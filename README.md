# Library Management System (C++)

A console-based Library Management System built in modern C++ (C++17), designed
with clean object-oriented architecture, file-based persistence, and a
menu-driven interface. Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate core
software engineering skills: OOP design, STL usage, file I/O, and modular
project structure.

## Features

- **Book management** — add, remove, list, and search books (by title,
  author, or ISBN)
- **Member management** — register, remove, and list library members
- **Circulation system** — issue and return books with automatic due-date
  tracking (14-day loan period)
- **Fine calculation** — automatic overdue fine computation (₹5/day) on return
- **Overdue report** — view all currently overdue loans across the library
- **Member loan history** — view a member's active borrowed books
- **Persistent storage** — all data is saved to plain-text files (`data/`)
  and reloaded automatically on the next run, so nothing is lost between
  sessions
- **Safety checks** — prevents removing a book that's currently on loan,
  removing a member with outstanding books, double-borrowing, or issuing an
  unavailable book

## Design Overview

- **`Book`** — represents a title with total/available copy counts.
- **`Member`** — represents a library member and the list of book IDs they
  currently have on loan.
- **`Transaction`** — represents a single issue/return event, including
  issue day, due day, return day, and any fine charged.
- **`Library`** — the core engine that owns all `Book`, `Member`, and
  `Transaction` collections, enforces business rules (availability checks,
  duplicate-loan prevention, fine calculation), and handles loading/saving
  to disk.

Each entity knows how to `serialize()`/`deserialize()` itself to a simple
pipe-delimited text format, keeping persistence logic self-contained and
easy to extend (e.g., swapping in SQLite later without touching business
logic in `Library`).

## Building & Running

Requires a C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., g++ 9+).

```bash
make          # builds the `library_system` executable
./library_system

# or in one step:
make run

# to clean build artifacts:
make clean
```

## Possible Extensions

- Swap flat-file storage for SQLite (schema maps cleanly onto the existing
  `Book`/`Member`/`Transaction` classes)
- Add an admin/user role split with authentication
- Wrap the `Library` engine in a REST API (e.g., using Crow or Pistache) to
  turn this into a full-stack project
- Add unit tests (e.g., with Catch2) for `Library`'s business rules

## Author's Note

This project was built to practice core software-engineering fundamentals —
OOP class design, separation of concerns (data model vs. business logic vs.
UI), file-based persistence, and STL containers/algorithms — outside of an
AI/ML context.
